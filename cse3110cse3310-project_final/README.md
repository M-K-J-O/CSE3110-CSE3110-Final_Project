# CSE3110CSE3310-Project_Final

## Description: 
Graphing Calculator aims to replicate most of the functions of a normal graphing calculator using python.
Currently, Graphing Calculator can graph a single expression from the gui, however we lack features such as: changing graph size (Min and Max values for x and y) Zooming in and out, search function, a grid and x and y-axis.

## Planning 
Graphing Calculator was created by me (Marco) and Rana. We split the Project into two parts, the Graphing Inputs part done by Marco, and the Graphing Outputs part done by Rana. This made it much easier to code together as completely separating the two parts until the end made sure there were not many conflicts, that is until we try to merge them.

## Feature List
- Graph Expression
- Pretty nice gui
- error checking

## Program Instructions
Type in an Expression such as "sin(x)" or click the buttons in the gui to type the expression
Follow the Syntax shown on the buttons or else the expression may return an error


## To do List:
- match case for exp searching for "^" and all np math funcs to return
- show me which variables change the MIN AND MAX of X and Y
- search function (allow user to find Min and Max and intersections)
- add more functionality to the graph
- [](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matplotlib-button-widget/)
=====================================================
- allow multiple expressions to be created and graphed at once
- allow changing of the Min and Max values of Y and X
- Integrate both Windows into one
- change button text to symbol where applicable
- Allow multiplication of variables without "*" symbol, for ex 2x instead of 2*x and multiplication via brackets
